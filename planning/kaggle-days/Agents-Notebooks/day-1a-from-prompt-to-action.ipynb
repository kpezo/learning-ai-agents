What languages is the SDK available in?,search online and find newest information about claude code and what is its version latest version\nhelpful_assistant > The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source framework that simplifies the development, deployment, and orchestration of AI agents. It brings software development best practices to AI agent creation, making it more manageable and akin to traditional software engineering. The ADK is designed to be model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, allowing it to work with various AI models and deployment environments, though it is optimized for Google's Gemini models and the Google Cloud ecosystem.\n\nKey features of the Agent Development Kit include:\n*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Enables the creation of complex AI systems by composing specialized agents that can collaborate to achieve sophisticated goals.\n*   **Flexible Orchestration:** Offers both predictable execution flows (sequential, parallel, loops) and dynamic, LLM-driven routing for adaptive agent behavior.\n*   **Extensive Tooling:** Agents can be augmented with a variety of tools, including pre-built functionalities like Search and Code Execution, custom functions, and integrations with popular libraries such as LangChain and LlamaIndex.\n*   **Code-First Approach:** Developers define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in code, which enhances debugging, version control, and deployment flexibility.\n*   **Deployment Optimizations:** The kit is optimized for deployment on Vertex AI Agent Engine Runtime, a managed service on Google Cloud.\n\nThe Agent Development Kit (ADK) SDK is currently available in the following programming languages:\n*   **Python**\n*   **Go**\n*   **Java**\n\nRegarding the latest information on Claude code and its latest version:\nClaude is a family of large language models developed by Anthropic. As of November 2025, the latest publicly announced model in the Claude family is **Claude 3**. The Claude 3 family consists of three models:\n*   **Claude 3 Haiku:** The fastest and most compact model, designed for near-instantaneous responses.\n*   **Claude 3 Sonnet:** A balanced model offering a good mix of speed and performance for enterprise workloads.\n*   **Claude 3 Opus:** The most powerful model, excelling at complex analysis, high-level understanding, and advanced reasoning tasks.\n\nAnthropic has not released specific \"Claude code\" as a separate SDK in the same way that Google has its Agent Development Kit. Instead, developers typically interact with Claude models through Anthropic's API. The latest information on using Claude with code would refer to the capabilities of the Claude 3 models accessed via their API, and any SDKs or libraries that facilitate this interaction, such as the `anthropic-sdk` for Python. For the most up-to-date details on the Claude 3 models and their capabilities, it's best to refer to Anthropic's official announcements and documentation.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can see a summary of ADK and its available languages in the response.\n\n### 2.4 How does it work?\n\nThe agent performed a Google Search to get the latest information about ADK, and it knew to use this tool because:\n\n1.
