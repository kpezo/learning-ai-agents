# Contracts: ADK Implementation Guide

**Status**: Not Applicable

This feature is documentation-only and does not expose any APIs or interfaces that require contract definitions.

## Rationale

The ADK Implementation Guide is a static markdown document (`planning/adk-guide.md`) that:
- Has no REST/GraphQL endpoints
- Has no programmatic interfaces
- Has no data exchange formats
- Is consumed by humans reading markdown

## Output Artifact

The sole output of this feature is:

```
planning/adk-guide.md
```

This file follows the structure defined in `spec.md` and `data-model.md` but does not require OpenAPI, GraphQL schema, or other contract definitions.
